		<h3>About</h3> 

		Hi! My name is Diana.
		<br><br>
		I grew up on the Internet drawing Neopets, reading fanfiction, and generally being up to no good. Then I grew up and put away childish things, except, uh, not really. Now I’m sharing and growing the world’s knowledge as a designer at Quora. 
		<br><br>
		This site is basically just a dump of stuff I work on and think about in my spare time. Let me know if you see anything you like!
